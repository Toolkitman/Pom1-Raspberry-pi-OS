Dear Woz HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!,
For your Birthday i want to share with you and my friend a little algorithm script on how i have made boot at startup
in Raspbian Buster for Raspberry pi The Pom 1 Emulator an Apple 1 emulator. And i have made my dream come true build a cheap
Apple 1:
Here the script. Go to Terminal than write sudo nano /etc/rc.local and write before the line exit 0 this sudo pom1 home/pi/pom1-1.0.0/pom1
press ctrl-X on the keyboard to close the windows.

Then you must install pom1 emulator from the arch version found here: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pom1/ under source 1 the tar.gz file
with this commands from terminal: 
The simplest way to compile this package is:

  0. Install SDL2: sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libzip-dev

  1. Uncompress the file writing tar xvzf /hom/pi/pom1-1.0.0.tar.gz or cd the folder it is inside.
     Open a Terminal and write: 
     cd Downloads or the directory and go in home/pi/pom1-1.0.0 and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.
     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type sudo make or make in terminal to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type then sudo make install or make install to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Then  go to terminal and write sudo raspi-config and select the voice boot options then select Desktop/CLI
and text autologin as pi.

Then go back with esc to the voice Advanced Options than Resolution than 720x480 save with finish.
Reboot
Enjoy your new APPLE 1 emulator directly booting from startup as a real computer.
You can find my Operative System ready to be installed in your Raspberry sd with Balena etcher and with instructions here:
